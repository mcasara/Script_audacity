This paper describes the implementation of scripted macros for Audacity. By using macros, the user not only saves time but also bypasses the GUI of the software. A flowchart is provided to help the user navigate within the different levels of the program. The current version supports the quick modification of any audio sample's volume, pitch and tempo, and allows to add effects such as wahwah, echo, fadein, fadeout, reverb and paulstretch.
